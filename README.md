# Requirements

Aside from Visual Studio Code, you need

1. FASM assebly flat compiler https://flatassembler.net/.  This will compile and link all 
libraries.  FASM is specific to Windows only.  For Ubuntu or Linux, it's a different compiler
altogether.

For OS other than Windows you'll need NASM assembler, you can download it here https://nasm.us/
Then you'll need a library linker like GoLink.
